	abstract = {With the rise of Approximate Computing as an energy-efﬁcient design paradigm that is amenable to errortolerant applications, different Approximate Logic Synthesis ({ALS}) techniques have been reported in the literature to generate approximate circuits from accurate implementations automatically. One {ALS} technique focuses on performing structural netlist transformations. The gate-level netlist representation of a circuit is simpliﬁed to reduce the circuit area and power consumption while producing a deﬁned error level at the output. However, currently, there is no framework or tool available to test and explore existing netlist transformation techniques for {ALS}. This limits the proposal of novel approaches and their corresponding comparison against state-of-the-art contributions. In this brief, we present {AxLS}, an open-source framework for {ALS} techniques based on netlist transformations. We validate our framework’s functionality by implementing a reported {ALS} technique and one proposed, using open-source circuit synthesis and simulation tools, and generating approximate arithmetic circuits from accurate {RTL} descriptions.},

	abstract = {Logic synthesis is a fundamental step in hardware design whose goal is to ﬁnd structural representations of Boolean functions while minimizing delay and area. If the function is completely-speciﬁed, the implementation accurately represents the function. If the function is incompletely-speciﬁed, the implementation has to be true only on the care set. While most of the algorithms in logic synthesis rely on {SAT} and Boolean methods to exactly implement the care set, we investigate learning in logic synthesis, attempting to trade exactness for generalization. This work is directly related to machine learning where the care set is the training set and the implementation is expected to generalize on a validation set. We present learning incompletely-speciﬁed functions based on the results of a competition conducted at {IWLS} 2020. The goal of the competition was to implement 100 functions given by a set of care minterms for training, while testing the implementation using a set of validation minterms sampled from the same function. We make this benchmark suite available and offer a detailed comparative analysis of the different approaches to learning.},

Thus, it is possible to decrease computing accuracy to achieve greater efficiency in area, performance, and/or energy consumption. In recent years, a slew of automatic techniques for approximate computing has been proposed; however, most of these techniques require full knowledge of an exact, or ‘golden’ circuit description. In contrast, there has been significant recent interest in synthesizing computation from examples, a form of supervised learning. In this paper, we explore the relationship between supervised learning of Boolean circuits and existing work on synthesizing incompletely-specified functions. We show that when considered through a machine learning lens, the latter work provides a good training accuracy but poor test accuracy. We contrast this with prior work from the 1990s which uses mutual information to steer the search process, aiming for good generalization. By combining this early work with a recent approach to learning logic functions, we are able to achieve a scalable and efficient machine learning approach for Boolean circuits in terms of area/delay/test-error trade-off.},

Due to the battery limitations of such edge devices, energy consumption has become a major problem. Tree-based models, such as Decision Trees ({DTs}) and Random Forests ({RFs}), are well-known {ML} tools that provide higher than standard accuracy results for several tasks. These tools are convenient for battery-powered devices due to their simplicity, and they can be further optimized with approximate computing techniques. This paper explores gate-level pruning for {DTs} and {RFs}. By using a framework that generates {VLSI} descriptions of the {ML} models, we investigate gate-level pruning to the mapped netlist generated after logic synthesis for three case studies. Several analyses on the energy- and area-accuracy trade-offs were performed and we found that we can obtain signiﬁcant energy and area savings for small or even negligible accuracy drops, which indicates that pruning techniques can be applied to optimize tree-based hardware implementations.},

	abstract = {Approximate Logic Synthesis ({ALS}) is the process of synthesizing and mapping a given Boolean network to a library of logic cells so that the magnitude/rate of error between outputs of the approximate and initial (exact) Boolean netlists is bounded from above by a predetermined total error threshold. In this paper, we present Q-{ALS}, a novel framework for {ALS} with focus on the technology mapping phase. Q-{ALS} incorporates reinforcement learning and utilizes Boolean difference calculus to estimate the maximum error rate that each node of the given network can tolerate such that the total error rate at non of the outputs of the mapped netlist exceeds a predetermined maximum error rate, and the worst case delay and the total area are minimized. Maximum Hamming Distance ({MHD}) between exact and approximate truth tables of cuts of each node is used as the error metric. In Q-{ALS}, a Q-Learning agent is trained with a sufﬁcient number of iterations aiming to select the ﬁttest values of {MHD} for each node, and in a cut-based technology mapping approach, the best supergates (in terms of delay and area, bounded further by the ﬁttest {MHD}) are selected towards implementing each node. Experimental results show that having set the required accuracy of 95\% at the primary outputs, Q-{ALS} reduces the total cost in terms of area and delay by up to 70\% and 36\%, respectively, and also reduces the run-time by 2.21× on average, when compared to the best state-of-the-art academic {ALS} tools.},

We utilize advances in deep learning to guide an approximate logic synthesis engine to minimize the dynamic power consumption of a given digital {CMOS} circuit, subject to a predetermined error rate at the primary outputs. Our framework, Deep-{PowerX}1, focuses on replacing or removing gates on a technology-mapped network and uses a Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) to predict error rates at primary outputs of the circuit when a specific part of the netlist is approximated. The primary goal of Deep-{PowerX} is to reduce the dynamic power whereas area reduction serves as a secondary objective. Using the said {DNN}, Deep-{PowerX} is able to reduce the exponential time complexity of standard approximate logic synthesis to linear time. Experiments are done on numerous open source benchmark circuits. Results show significant reduction in power and area by up to 1.47× and 1.43× compared to exact solutions and by up to 22\% and 27\% compared to state-of-the-art approximate logic synthesis tools while having orders of magnitudes lower run-time.},

	abstract = {Understanding the structure and function of circuits is crucial for electronic design automation ({EDA}). Circuits can be formulated as And-Inverter graphs ({AIGs}), enabling efficient implementation of representation learning through graph neural networks ({GNNs}). Masked modeling paradigms have been proven effective in graph representation learning. However, masking augmentation to original circuits will destroy their logical equivalence, which is unsuitable for circuit representation learning. Moreover, existing masked modeling paradigms often prioritize structural information at the expense of abstract information such as circuit function. To address these limitations, we introduce {MGVGA}, a novel constrained masked modeling paradigm incorporating masked gate modeling ({MGM}) and Verilog-{AIG} alignment ({VGA}). Specifically, {MGM} preserves logical equivalence by masking gates in the latent space rather than in the original circuits, subsequently reconstructing the attributes of these masked gates. Meanwhile, large language models ({LLMs}) have demonstrated an excellent understanding of the Verilog code functionality. Building upon this capability, {VGA} performs masking operations on original circuits and reconstructs masked gates under the constraints of equivalent Verilog codes, enabling {GNNs} to learn circuit functions from {LLMs}. We evaluate {MGVGA} on various logic synthesis tasks for {EDA} and show the superior performance of {MGVGA} compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Such models generally provide optimality in compact size or empirical accuracy. Recent works focus on improving efficiency due to the natural scalability issue. The application of such models to practical problems is quite limited. As an emerging problem in circuit design, Approximate Logic Synthesis ({ALS}) aims to reduce circuit complexity by sacrificing correctness. Recently, multiple heuristic machine learning methods have been applied in {ALS}, which learns approximated circuits from samples of input-output pairs.
 In this paper, we propose a new {ALS} methodology realizing the approximation via learning optimal decision trees in empirical accuracy. Compared to previous heuristic {ALS} methods, the guarantee of optimality achieves a more controllable trade-off between circuit complexity and accuracy. Experimental results show clear improvements in our methodology in the quality of approximated designs (circuit complexity and accuracy) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

The optimization flow improves solutions found by other techniques, using them for bootstrapping the evolutionary process.
